# How-To-Think-Like-a-Computer-Scientist
My solutions to exercises from the book <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. Python Version"</a> by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers

The repository doesn't contain answers to all exercises. I've chosen only those I found particularly interesting.

All solutions are written in Python 3.x.
